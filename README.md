# JAVA-PROGRAM-TASK-4-2D-ARRAY-
1.	Print a 2D Array:
Write a Java program to print all elements of a given 2D array.

This Java program prints a 2D array in a matrix format using a nested for-loop. It starts by declaring and initializing a 3×3 matrix named arr, where each row contains an array of integers. The program then uses a nested for-loop to iterate through the array. The outer loop runs through each row of the array, while the inner loop iterates through each element within the row. Each element is printed using System.out.print(), ensuring that elements in the same row appear on the same line. After each row is printed, System.out.println() moves the cursor to a new line, maintaining the matrix format. 

2.	Sum of Elements:
Write a Java program to calculate the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

This Java program calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array using a nested enhanced for-loop. It begins by declaring and initializing a 3×3 matrix named arr, containing integers arranged in rows and columns. A variable sum is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum of the elements. The program then uses an outer enhanced for-loop to iterate through each row of the array, treating each row as a 1D array. Within this loop, an inner enhanced for-loop iterates through each element (num) in the row, adding its value to sum. Once all elements have been processed, the final sum is printed using System.out.println(). The output of the program is "Sum of all elements: 45", as the total of all elements in the array is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. This approach effectively demonstrates how to traverse and manipulate 2D arrays using nested loops in Java.
